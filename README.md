// Problem 01:
=============
A seat planner needs to be created for a new cinema hall. The seats in this cinema hall are designed in such a way that if the seat number is divisible by 3 or 5 and there is no remainder then it will be considered as a 'premium' seat. That is, if the seat number is 1 then it will be a normal seat, if the seat number is 3/5 then it will be a premium seat

Problem: Your task is to create a program that will take the total number of seats (totalRows) and for each seat it will print whether it is a 'Normal Row' or a 'Premium Row'. Row 1 - Normal Row, Row 4 - Premium Row

ADVANCED: If the seat is normal then the prize will be 500 Taka and if it is a premium seat then the prize will be 800 Taka. You need to calculate the total income of a show e.g. Total Income: 5000 Taka

// Problem 02 : 
Product Tagging
For an online store, you need to write a program (productDescription) that takes (string) input and automatically adds some tags (Tags) based on the product details. For example:

details

If the word "cotton" is in the details, then the program output will show "Material: Cotton".

If the word "sale" is in the details, then the program output will show "Category: Sale Item".

If the word "new arrival" is in the details, then the program output will show "Status: New Arrival".

If the word "limited edition" is in the details, then the program output will show "Availability: Limited".

If none of the conditions are met, then a default tag "Tag: General"

ADVANCED: Handle case insensitively.
